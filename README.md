# HD120-Lighting-Controller-Software
### A Visual C# program that makes usage of Charixfox's HD120 Controller easy
  A few years back, Charixfox [wrote some Arduino code](https://github.com/Charixfox/HD120-Controller) which would allow one to create a  much more sophisticated and customizable lighting controller for their Corsair HD120 & LL120 RGB fans. This code, however, operates entirely over non-intuitive and non-user-friendly serial commands.
  For this reason, I have created a GUI-based program to "control Charxfox's controller" which allows one to do everything they could using straight serial code, *and more*.
### I mean, obviously...
  This program will allow you to quickly and easily control your Arduino that has had Charixfox's fan controller software uploaded to it.
  Gone are serial commands (I mean, if you want to still do those then there is an option for it in this program), replaced by drop-down menus and buttons. Basically, this program takes what you select and generates the serial commands to send to the arduino for you. Well, that's pretty simple, but can it do anything *absolutely neato*?
## You bet it can!
  Sequencing! While setting effects is cool, and sitting at your computer manually "sequencing" for hours on end is even cooler, why not *automate it*!
  So, I have. Just skip on over to the sequencing tab in this application and voil√†! You can sequence and loop up to 12 individual effects
  and set the precise time between the execution of the effects. Again, the option to input custom serial commands still exists for each of these effects.
